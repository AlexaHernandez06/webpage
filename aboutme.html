            <small>Hey guys!<br>Here is a little about myself</small>
            <p id="text">My name is Alexa Hernandez and I am a junior at Clovis High school. I also attend CART for the engineering class in the morning. When I am not at school, I am either at a cheer practice or doing homework sadly. On my free time I like to hang out with my friends or either walk my dog. Dogs are my favorite animals and personally, I think they are better than cats, but I love both. On a couple of tabs, I have images of some of the cutest dogs and cats I've ever tseen.</p>
